# Motivation and principles   

This document details the `XLUM` format, an XML based file format for long-term data preservation and exchange of luminescence data. The format is readable by humans and machines, and the data can be easily checked with any text reader on any major operating system. This design allows a platform-independent operation. The following documentation provides essential information on the file `XLUM` format  and accounts for the needs for individual flexible data analysis, even with self-written software applications.

Three simple design principles underpin the format specification:

* Stored are data recorded over **time** or time derived instances, 
* stored are data on a technical component level, 
* data stored in a file are self-consistent.

# General description

The `XLUM`-format is an [XML](https://www.w3.org/xml) derivative. The base data structure is a 
tree with five nodes types storing the data. Each level has its unique denotation.

The levels and a short introduction is given in the table below. A detailed description can be found in the following sections. 
Nodes represent each level in the structure. **Only `<curve>` nodes contain physical quantities, such as luminescence data** all other nodes are parent nodes of `<curve>` 
to structure the dataset and ship additional metadata. 

The first level, `xlum` is a root node to enable storage of luminescence data in arbitrary files following the XML scheme. As a side effect this also allows custom file endings different from `*.xlum`.


  |Node name       | Number of samples   |Number of aliquots  | Number of records  | Number of data curves |
  |:---------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:----------------------|
  `<xlum/>`         |$\inf$               |$\inf$              |$\inf$              |$\inf$  
  `<sample/>`       |1                    |$\inf$              |$\inf$              |$\inf$
  `<sequence/>`     |1                    |1                   |$\inf$              |$\inf$
  `<record/>`       |1                    |1                   |1                   |$\inf$
  `<curve/>`        |1                    |1                   |1                   | 1  

  Table: Node overview

A node has a name, attributes, and data stored in it. The data stored in the attributes describe the state of this level. The stored data in the node describes the process(es) assigned to the node. A minimal example is shown in the listing. The documentation provides an overview starting with the leaf node description and going up to the root from there. Further notes:

* The format version bases on [XML version 1.0 (Fifth Edition)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)
* File encoding should always be UTF-8
* This specification lists only mandatory attributes. Additional, custom attributes are explicitly supported.
* Parser supporting the `XLUM` format must not crash when encountering non-specified node attributes. However, they may skip them.

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<xlum>
  <sample>
    <sequence>
      <record>
        <curve> 
          1 2 ... n
        </curve>
      </record>
    </sequence>
  </sample>
</xlum>
```

# Detailed description

## The `<curve/>` level

The `<curve/>` level is the deepest node (leaf) and has no further sub-levels. 
A curve holds the predefined/simulated or measured output of one single 
technical component. For example, a typical thermoluminescence measurement 
may consist of one or many curves.

1. **The one curve example**: Time against temperature. In this case temperature
 is a processed quantity, because measurements happen over a time instant. However, for compatibility reasons, this would be allowed although it is not preferred.

2. **The three curve example**: (a) Time against temperature recorded by a thermocouple (temperature sensor), (b) time against photon counts recorded by a photomultiplier tube, (c) time against a predefined heating ramp.

In both cases, all mentioned `<curve/>` nodes belong to one parent `<record/>`. In case 1, 
the record contains one curve and three in case 2. Ideally, curves represent technical 
components and not processed quantities. 

### Value storage

Numerical values in the `<curve/>` node are stored white space separated. **Only quantities detected
by a detector/sensor are stored in this node.** This includes simulated values. 
Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) shows three types of (luminescence) detectors, distinguished by their capacity to record spatially resolved information. 
Regardless of the detector, recorded quantities are stored in the `<curve/>` node 
separated by white space. Example: 

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
<curve>59.5167 109.5164 149.7003 109.5170 156.2654</curve>
```

Values in the node are real numbers (-1e-307 $\leqslant x \leqslant$ 1e+307; $x \in \mathbb{R}$).
Scientific 'E'/'e' notations of numbers are explicitly allowed, example: 1e+2 for 100 or 1e-2 for 0.01.
Decimal separator is a `.` (dot). **Other separators, for instance to separate groups of numbers
are not allowed** to avoid decimal delimiter problems. Examples:  

* 10000.00 -> OK
* 10 000.00 -> NOT OK
* 10,000.00 -> NOT OK
 
To reduce the size of the file, for instance for image data, the string in `<curve/>` can be stored using [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding. It is up to the parser to decide whether the string 
was encoded or not! Encoding in other places (attributes) is not supported and must not be expected by 
the parser. 

*Please note that the XSD document does not specify binary encoding because it considers all values in `<curve/>` strings (which can represent encoded values).*

For consistency reasons, the value in the node span an array with dimensions 
defined through the node attributes `xValues`, `yValues` and `tValues` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:fig1)).

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="The three cases for data storage depending on the detector. The black solid arrows indicate how the array is constructed from the values stored in the node."}
try(knitr::include_graphics("img/Curve_Level_Storage.png", auto_pdf = TRUE, dpi = 300), 
    silent = TRUE)
```
  
1. The simplest form is a detector that records no spatial information. For instance,
a photomultiplier tube only knows about count recorded over time. Alternatively, the
detector can be any sensor, measuring, e.g., temperature, pressure or current. 

2. A spectrometer (here a camera in front of a spectrograph) is another type of 
detector with spatial information, here wavelengths split by the spectrograph 
hitting different pixel areas of the detector. 

3. The most complex from is a detector that records events (e.g., luminescence), 
spatially resolved. Such as a camera. 

In the examples and Fig.\@ref(fig:fig1) the detectors detect luminescence. However, any type of sensor, electronic component recording information of
relevance for the measurement of luminescence are suitable. Typical examples:

* Temperature sensor (thermocouple), recording the temperature of the heating element
* Photo diode, monitoring the optical power density at the sample position
* Resistor, measuring the current of a LED
* Pressure sensor, monitoring the atmosphere in the measurement chamber
* Inductive sensor, monitoring closing and opening of a shutter

  Table: Specified curve attributes. Attributes in `[]` are optional, hence `NA` is not allowed.

### Example 

In order to define a suitable standard only a few attributes are required. A few of them are useful for every kind of component, 
others are only meaningful in combination. For instance, providing information on the detection window is not meaningful for 
a heating element. 

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
{...}
  <curve component="heating element" startDate="2021-02-14T22:57:00.0Z" 
    curveType="predefined" duaration="5" 
    offset="0" xValues="NA" yValues="NA" 
    tValues="1 2 3 4 5" xLabel="NA" yLabel="NA"
    tLabel="time" vLabel="temperature" xUnit="NA" yUnit="NA" vUnit="K" tUnit="s">
        293 303 313 323 333
  </curve>
  <curve component="thermo couple" startDate="2021-02-14T22:57:00.0Z" 
    curveType="measured" duaration="5" 
    offset="0" xValues="NA" yValues="NA" tValues="1 2 3 4 5" xLabel="NA" yLabel="NA"
    vLabel="temperature" tLabel="time" xUnit="NA" yUnit="NA" vUnit="K" tUnit="s">
        293 303 313 323 333
  </curve>
  <curve component="EMI 9123QB15" startDate="2021-02-14T22:57:00.0Z" 
    curveType="measured" duaration="5" offset="0" xValues="NA" yValues="NA" 
    tValues="1 2 3 4 5" xLabel="NA" yLabel="NA"
    vLabel="luminescence" tLabel="time" xUnit="NA" yUnit="NA" vUnit="cts" 
    tUnit="s" detectionWindow="380 nm" filter="Hoya U340 + Delta 365/40">
        20 25 32 41 46
  </curve>
{...}
```

One curve is related to one technical device. To define a accurate time window, 
the parameters *duration* and *offset* should be used. These parameters are related to the 
start of the parent `<record/>` node.

## The `<record/>` level

A `<record>` defines one process involving many components, hence `<record>` may 
contain $1\leq n\leq Inf; n \in \mathbb{Z}$ `<curve>` nodes.  A record can also be understood 
as one step in a measurement sequence, e.g., a TL measurement. All curves within the record should have been 
detected within the same time frame defined through the attributes `<startDate>` and the duration of the step.

### Attributes

  |Identifier          | Type          |Allows `NA`? | Example        |Information  |
  |:-------------------|:--------------|:------------|:---------------|:------------|
  |recordType          |`string`       |no          |  `"TL"`                  |  valid values according to the `recordType` table                 |
  |sequenceStepNumber  |`unsignedInt`      |yes         |  `5`                     |  index in the sequence     |
  |sampleCondition     |`string`       |yes         |  dose                    | valid values according to the table below |
  
  Table: Allowed attributes for `<record>` node.

The `recordType` names are not carved in stone, but should be chosen to best describe a record in one
word or using an accepted abbreviation (e.g., OSL for optically stimulated luminescence). 
However, it is important to keep in mind that the `recordType` makes **no** claim on the technical 
components involved, but is solely set to ease the understanding of the record. The hard 
physical information is stored in the `<curve>` node.

  |`recordType`          | Information      |

  |`"custom"`            | any undefined or custom record type  not listed above   |
  
  Table: Valid `recordTypes`

Valid entries for for  `sampleConditions` are given in the following table:

  |`sampleCondition`   |  Information        |
  |:-------------------|:--------------------|
  |`"Natural"`            | natural luminescence signal   |
  |`"Natural+Dose"`       | natural luminescence signal with additive dose  |

  |`"Dose"`               |  artificially irradiated sample  |
  |`"Background"`         |  background |
  
  Table: Valid values for `sampleConditions`
  
*Please note that the attribute `sampleCondition` is of informative nature, accounting
for information stored in BIN/BINX-files. The field can be set to `NA`.*

### Example 

The following examples consists of two records. 

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
{...}
    <record recordType="GSL" sequenceStepNumber="1" sampleCondition="NA">
      <curve ...>
        {...}
      </curve>
      <curve ...>
        {...}
      </curve>
    </record>
    <record recordType="bleaching" sequenceStepNumber="2" sampleCondition="NA">
      <curve ...>
        {...}
      </curve>
    </record>
{...}
```

## The `<sequence/>` level

A sequence describes multiple measurements sequentially used at **one** aliquot, 
for instance as cup/disc with multiple grains or a single grain. Hence, another
aliquot from the **same** sample and the sample sequence needs to be wrapped in a new `<sequence/>` node. 
Naturally the information stored an that level can be very verbose, but are limited to  
a few required attributes only. In the luminescence context a sequence can fit, e.g., 
a SAR protocol, but also a succession of protocols measured on one aliquot.

## The `<xlum/>` level 

The `<xlum>` is the format parent node and it can contain an infinite number
of samples. Only this level allows to set a license for the distribution 
and usage of the data. All data within a particular `<xlum>` are considered
distributed under the license. You have to create new instances of the `<xlum>` 
to set different licenses.

## General parameters (all nodes)

A few attributes are available on all node levels except the root node `<xlum>`. These attributes are mainly of technical nature to ease the sequential data storage during the measurement process (such as `parentID`).

  |Identifier    |Data type       |Allows `NA`?         |Example               |Information      |

  |state        |`string`         |yes                  |`"recording"`         |defines the state of the node; only used by equipment manufactures 
  |parentID     |`token`         |yes                  |`"201007145551910"`   |uniquely identifying the parent node, the root node has the ID `0`, this is usually not needed but may help to store data |
  |comment      |`String`         |yes                  |`"what a wonderful sample"`| comment field |

# Special cases

This section provides suggestions for attributes for particular types of measurements. 
These attributes are not compulsory, but if needed should be used for the sake of consistency. 

Please note: these metadata are not required to store and analyse the data!

## Pulsing data (optional)

In measurements with pulsed light stimulation, data processing usually requires summations of photon counts on the hardware level using so-called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). It is neither meaningful nor feasible to store single counts in separate curves for photon arrival times of $10^{-6} \leq \tau \leq 10^{-3}$ s. Hence, multiple detectors `<curve/>` data may be stored per `<record/>`, one for each (x) pulse(-s). In those cases, the `<record/>` node contains additional metadata that may help understand the data and pre-processing by the hardware level better. All attributes are optional.

  |Identifier        | Data type    |Example    |Information            |
  |:-----------------|:-------------|:----------|:----------------------|
  |onTime            |`numeric`     |`"1E-01"` | on time of stimulation per pulse, [s]     |
  |offTime           |`numeric`     |`"1E-01"` | on time of stimulation per pulse, [s]    |
  |nPulses           |`numeric`     |`"10"`     | number of stimulation pulses total     |
  |summations        |`numeric`     |`"2"`     | how many consecutive pulse records are summed (e.g. 10 pulses, 2 summations -> 5 records) |
  |channelsPerPulse  |`numeric`     |`"1000"`   | number of channels that are recorded in one curve      |
  |countsNormalised  |`numeric`     |`"1"`    |  if not 0, counts per channel are normalized to counts per second (helpful with uneven distributed channel times) |

## Risø BIN/BINX to XLUM metadata argument matching

Risø BIN/BINX files consist of a [metadata header block and a data block](https://r-luminescence.org/tutorials/binx2r/). Some of
the metadata serves the sole purpose of describing the structure of the data block, 
others return the specific equipment status but are non-relevant for the data analysis. 

Most BIN/BINX metadata is covered by the XLUM format by design and hence finds their expression implicitly. The following argument list contains
**all** possible arguments in BIN/BINX files, however, not all BIN/BINX
file versions support all arguments. Covered here are BIN/BINX files between 
versions 03 to 08.

*Note: metadata tagged with "considered non-relevant" or "usage unknown" indicate that they are not considered (yet) as relevant enough for long-term data preservation and are hence not to be included as a compulsory argument in the XLUM format definition. However, they **can** still be stored in the XLUM format regardless.* 


## Freiberg Instruments XSYG argument matching

The XYSG file format by Freiberg Instruments is already an XML-based file format
and can be somewhat considered as the predecessor of the XLUM format. The format
was developed in February 2013 but never formally published. Main differences
are: 

* The XSYG file format consists of only four node instead of five like. Parent node `xlum`
exists only for the XLUM format
* Nodes start with a capital letter (e.g., `<Sample>`, instead of `<sample>` in XLUM)
* The individual curves values are stored as a pair-list with values separated by a semicolon `;`, in the `<Curve>` node, i.e., `x0 , y0 ; x1 , y1 ; x2 , y2 ; x3 , y3`. XLUM uses attributes instead, and values are stored separated through white space
* For spectrometer data the XSYG format defines an alternative storage format of values in the `<Curve>` node of form `1.0 ,[554|555|559|553|556|550| {...}`. Contrary, XLUM maintains a consistent storage format.
* The chosen date format was not ISO conform 

In the following, the argument matching is listed per node.
