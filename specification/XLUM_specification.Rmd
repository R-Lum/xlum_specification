# Motivation and principles

This document details the `XLUM` format, an XML based file format for long-term data preservation and exchange of luminescence data. The format is readable by humans and machines, and the data can be easily checked with any text reader on any major operating system. This design allows a platform-independent operation. The following documentation provides essential information on the file `XLUM` format  and accounts for the needs for individual flexible data analysis, even with 
self-written software applications.

Three simple design principles underpin the format specification:

* Stored are data recorded over **time** or time derived instances, 
* stored are data on a technical component level, 
* data stored in a file are self-consistent.

# General description

The `XLUM`-format is an [XML](https://www.w3.org/xml) derivative. The base data structure is a 
tree with five nodes storing the data. Each level has its unique denotation.

The levels and a short introduction is given in the table below. A detailed description can be found in the following sections. 
Nodes represent each level in the structure. **Only `<curve>` nodes contain physical quantities, such as luminescence data** all other nodes are parent nodes of `<curve>` 
to structure the dataset and ship additional metadata. 

The first level, `xlum` is a supernode to enable storage of luminescence data in arbitrary files following the XML scheme. As a side effect this 
also allows custom file endings different from `*.xlum`.


  |Node name       | Number of samples   |Number of aliquots  | Number of records  | Number of data curves |
  |:---------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:----------------------|
  `<xlum>`         |$\inf$               |$\inf$              |$\inf$              |$\inf$  
  `<sample>`       |1                    |$\inf$              |$\inf$              |$\inf$
  `<sequence>`     |1                    |1                   |$\inf$              |$\inf$
  `<record>`       |1                    |1                   |1                   |$\inf$
  `<curve>`        |1                    |1                   |1                   | 1  

  Table: Node overview

A node has a name, attributes, and data stored in it. The data stored in the attributes describe the state of this level. The stored data in the node describes the process(es) assigned to the node. A minimal example is shown in the listing. The documentation provides an overview starting with the leaf node description and going up to the root from there. Further notes:

* The format version bases on [XML version 1.0 (Fith Edition)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)
* File encoding should always be UTF-8
* This specification lists only mandatory attributes. Additional, custom attributes are explicitly supported.
* Parser supporting the `XLUM` format must not crash when encountering non-specified node attributes. However, they may skip them.

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xlum>
  <sample>
    <sequence>
      <record>
        <curve> 
          1,2,...,n
        </curve>
      </record>
    </sequence>
  </sample>
</xlum>
```

# Detailed description

## The `<curve/>` level

The `curve` level is the deepest node (leaf) and has no further sub-levels. 
A curve holds the predefined/simulated or measured output of one single 
technical component. For example, a typical thermoluminescence measurement 
may consist of one or many curves.

 1. **The three curve example**: (a) Time against temperature recorded by a thermocouple 
 (temperature sensor), (b) time against photon counts recorded by a photomultiplier tube, 
 (c) time against a predefined heating ramp.
 2. **The one curve example**: Time against temperature. In this case temperature
 is a processed quantity, because measurements happen over a time instant. However, for
 compatibility reasons, this would be allowed although it is not preferred.

In both cases, all mentioned `curve` nodes belong to one parent `record`. In case 1, 
the record contains one curve and three in case 2. Ideally, curves represent technical 
components and not processed quantities. 

### Value storage

Values in the `<curve>` node are stored comma separated. **Only quantities detected
by a detector/sensor are stored in this node.** This includes simulated values. 
Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) shows three types of (luminescence) detectors, distinguished by their capacity to record spatially resolved information. 
Regardless of the detector, recorded quantities are stored in the `<curve>` node 
separated by a comma. Example: 

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
<curve>59.5167,109.5164,149.7003,109.5170,156.2654</curve>
```

Values in the node are real numbers (-1e-307 $\leqslant x \leqslant$ 1e+307; $x \in \mathbb{R}$).
Scientific 'E'/'e' notations of numbers are explicitly allowed, example: 1e+2 for 100 or 1e-2 for 0.01.
Decimal separator is a `.` (dot).

For consistency reasons, the value in the node span an array with dimensions 
defined through the node attributes `xValues`, `yValues` and `tValues` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:fig1)).

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="The three cases for data storage depending on the detector. The black solid arrows indicate how the array is constructed from the values stored in the node."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Curve_Level_Storage.png", auto_pdf = TRUE, dpi = 300)
```

1. The simplest form is a detector that records no spatial information. For instance,
a photomultiplier tube only knows about count recorded over time. Alternatively, the
detector can be any sensor, measuring, e.g., temperature, pressure or current. 

2. A spectrometer (here a camera in front of a spectrograph) is another type of 
detector with spatial information, here wavelengths split by the spectrograph 
hitting different pixel areas of the detector. 

3. The most complex from is a detector that records events (e.g., luminescence), 
spatially resolved. Such as a camera. 

In the examples and the Fig.\@ref(fig:fig1) the detectors detect luminescence, 
however, any type of sensor, electronic component recording information of
relevance for the measurement of luminescence are suitable. Typical examples:

* Temperature sensor (thermocouple), recording the temperature of the heating element
* Photo diode, monitoring the optical power density at the sample position
* Resistor, measuring the current of a LED
* Pressure sensor, monitoring the atmosphere in the measurement chamber
* Inductive sensor, monitoring closing and opening of a shutter

  Table: Specified curve attributes. Attributes in `[]` are optional, hence `NA` is not allowed.

### Example 

In order to define a suitable standard only a few attributes are required. A few of them are useful for every kind of component, 
others are only meaningfully in combination. For instance, providing information on the detection window is not meaningful for 
a heating element. 

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
{...}
  <curve component="heating element" startDate="2021-02-14T22:57:00.0Z" curveType="predefined" duaration="5" 
    offset="0" xValues="NA" yValues="NA" tValues="1,2,3,4,5" xLabel="NA" yLabel="NA"
    tLabel="time" vLabel="temperature" xUnit="" yUnit="" vUnit="K" tUnit="s">
        293,303,313,323,333
  </curve>
  <curve component="thermo couple" startDate="2021-02-14T22:57:00.0Z" curveType="measured" duaration="5" 
    offset="0" xValues="NA" yValues="NA" tValues="1,2,3,4,5" xLabel="NA" yLabel="NA"
    vLabel="temperature" tLabel="time" xUnit="" yUnit="" vUnit="K" tUnit="s">
        293,303,313,323,333
  </curve>
  <curve component="EMI 9123QB15" startDate="2021-02-14T22:57:00.0Z" curveType="measured" duaration="5" 
    offset="0" xValues="NA" yValues="NA" tValues="1,2,3,4,5" xLabel="NA" yLabel="NA"
    vLabel="luminescence" tLabel="time" xUnit="" yUnit="" vUnit="cts" tUnit="s" 
    detectionWindow="380 nm" filter="Hoya U340 + Delta 365/40">
        20,25,32,41,46
  </curve>
{...}
```

One curve is related to one technical device. To define a accurate time window, 
the parameters *duration* and *offset* should be used. These parameters are related to the 
start of the parent `<record>` node.

## The `<record/>` level

A `<record>` defines one process involving many components, hence `<record>` may 
contain $1\leq n\leq Inf; n \in \mathbb{Z}$ `<curve>` nodes.  A record can also be understood 
as one step in a measurement sequence, e.g., a TL measurement. All curves within the record should have been 
detected within the same time frame defined through the attributes `<startDate>` and `<endDate>`.

  Table: Allowed attributes for `<record>` node.

The `recordType` names are not carved in stone, but should be chosen to best describe a record in one
word or using an accepted abbreviation (e.g., OSL for optically stimulated luminescence). 
However, it is important to keep in mind that the `recordType` makes **no** claim on the technical 
components involved, but is solely set to ease the understanding of the record. The hard 
physical information a stored in the `<curve>` node.

### Example 

The following examples consists of two records. 

```{r, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
{...}
    <record startDate="2021-02-14T22:59:35.0Z" endDate="2021-02-14T23:10:00.0Z"
       recordType="GSL" description="green OSL CW" sequenceStepNumber="1" 
       sampleCondition="NA">
      <curve ...>
        {...}
      </curve>
      <curve ...>
        {...}
      </curve>
    </record>
    <record startDate="2021-02-14T23:10:10.0Z" endDate="2021-02-14T23:20:00.0Z"
       recordType="bleach" description="bleaching with solar simulator" 
       sequenceStepNumber="2" sampleCondition="NA">
      <curve ...>
        {...}
      </curve>
    </record>
{...}
```

## The `<sequence/>` level

A sequence describes multiple measurements sequentially used at **one** aliquot, 
for instance as cup/disc with multiple grains or a single grain. Hence, another
aliquot from the **same** sample needs to be wrapped in a new `<sequence>` node. 
Naturally the information stored an that level can be very verbose, but are limited to  
a few required attributes only. In the luminescence context a sequence can fit, e.g., 
a SAR protocol, but also a succession of protocols measured on one aliquot.

## The `<xlum/>` level 

The `<xlum>` is the format parent node and it can contain an infinite number
of samples. Only this level allows to set a licence for the distribution 
and usage of the data. All data within a particular `<xlum>` are considered
distributed under the licence. You have to create new instances of the `<xlum>` 
to set different licences.

## General parameters (all nodes)

A few nodes are available on all node levels except the super node `<xlum>`. There are mainly of technical 
nature to ease the sequential of data storage during the measurement process.

  |Identifier    |Data type       |Allows `NA`?         |Example               |Information      |
  |:-------------|:---------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|:----------------|
  |state        |`string`         |yes                  |`"recording"`         |defines the state of the node; only used by equipment manufactures 
  |parentID     |`number`         |yes                  |`"201007145551910"`   |unique identifying the parent node, the super node has the ID `0`, this is usually not needed but may help to store data |
  |comment      |`String`         |yes                  |`"what a wonderful sample"`| comment field |

# Special cases

This section provides suggestions for attributes for particular types of measurements. 
These attributes are not compulsory, but may be used for the sake of consistency. 

Either way, these metadata must not be required to store and analyse the data!

## Pulsing data

In measurements with pulsed light stimulation data processing usually requires 
summations of photon counts on the hardware level, because it is neither meaningful 
nor feasible to store every single count in separate curves for photon arrival 
times of $10^{-6} \leq \tau \leq 10^{-3}$ s. Hence, multiple detector `<curve>` data may be stored per `<record>`, 
one for each (x) pulse(-s). The `<record>` node  contains some additional metadata that may help 
to understand the data and the undertaken processing on the hardware level better.

  |Identifier        | Data type    |Example    |Information            |
  |:-----------------|:-------------|:----------|:----------------------|
  |onTime            |`numeric`     |`"1E-01"` | on time of stimulation per pulse, [s]     |
  |offTime           |`numeric`     |`"1E-01"` | on time of stimulation per pulse, [s]    |
  |nPulses           |`numeric`     |`"10"`     | number of stimulation pulses total     |
  |summations        |`numeric`     |`"2"`     | how many consecutive pulse records are summed (e.g. 10 pulses, 2 summations -> 5 records) |
  |channelsPerPulse  |`numeric`     |`"1000"`   | number of channels that are recorded in one curve      |
  |countsNormalized  |`numeric`     |`"1"`    |  if not 0, counts per channel are normalized to counts per second (helpful with uneven distributed channel times) |

Also the curves contain additional metadata

  |Identifier         |Data type   |Example    |Information |
  |:------------------|:-----------|:----------|:---------------------------------------|
  |pulseID            |`numeric`   |`"1"`     | current pulse number |

# Pratical examples

This section contains detailed examples for particular curve types in order 
to provide usable examples for the data format.
